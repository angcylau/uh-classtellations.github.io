## Overview

UH Plan View is an interactive visual guide to help UH students optimize their path to graduation.  By showing progress, prerequisites, and timing of classes, students can experiment with the ordering of remaining classes with a click-and-drag interface.

A student's progress on general UH requirements and major requirements are indicated along with remaining major classes.  Prerequisite dependencies are shown with arrows along with credit hours totals for each semester.

UH Plan View utilizes the following frameworks:

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

## Example enhancements

The following enhancements could be made for improved utility:

* Indication of available courses to satisfy general eduction requirements (requires direct interaction with STAR database). STAR currently has a user-friendly search for this, but direct integration into the visualizer could be helpful.
* Support for departments beyond ICS
* Support for double majors
* Support for prospective students (who don’t have a MyUH account) and are willing to manually enter AP credits etc.
* Long-term: interaction with STAR’s actual enrollment system.
